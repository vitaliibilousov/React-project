```twoslash include main
import { FC } from "react";
import { Canvas } from "@react-three/fiber";
import { useRegister, helpers, orchestrate } from "jongleur";
import { Vector3 } from "three";

const clips = orchestrate(
  // The `Base`
  {
    one: {
      opacity: 0,
      config: { damping: false },
    },
    two: { position: new Vector3(0, 0, 0) },
    // NOTE: New object for the showcase
    three: {
      intensity: 0, 
      position: new Vector3(0, 0, 0)
    }

  // The `Keyframes`
  {
    one: {
      1: { opacity: helpers.state(1) },
    },
    two: {
      0.5: { position: helpers.inherit },
      1: {
        position: helpers.state(
            new Vector3(1, 1, 1),
            "ease-in-out"
        ),

const App: FC = () => {
  const register = useRegister(clips);
  
  return (
      <Canvas>
        <mesh ref={register("two", "foo")}>
          <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
          <meshStandardMaterial color={"orange"} />
        </mesh>
        <group position={[1, 0, 1]}>
          <mesh ref={register("two", "bar")}>
            <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
            <meshStandardMaterial color={"blue"} />
          </mesh>

Once you defined the scene and registered the moving parts, there is only one step left. Provide a form of progress. On this page, three forms of progress will be covered. First of all *time progress* and then *scroll progress*. In the end, we will also see how you can implement your own progress mechanism.

<Alert type="info">
The examples here are based on the same `clips` store, that was initialized in the [previous page](./progress). Be sure to check out that part of the guide first...

<Collapsible client:load title="This is the setup I am talking about">

```tsx twoslash
// @include: main
```

</Collapsible>


## Time progress

Perhaps the simplest form of progress, is time progress. This progress just continously updates the scene with looping or as a one shot playback:


```tsx twoslash 
// @include: main



```
