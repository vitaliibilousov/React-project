Once you defined the scene and registered the moving parts, there is only one step left. Provide a form of progress. On this page, three forms of progress will be covered. First of all *time progress* and then *scroll progress*. In the end, we will also see how you can implement your own progress mechanism.

<Alert type="info">
The examples here are based on the same `clips` store, that was initialized in the [previous page](./progress). Be sure to check out that part of the guide first...
</Alert>

<Collapsible client:load title="This is the setup I am talking about">

```tsx twoslash
// @include: main

const App: FC = () => {
  const register = useRegister(clips);
  
  return (
      <Canvas>
        <mesh ref={register("two", "foo")}>
          <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
          <meshStandardMaterial color={"orange"} />
        </mesh>
        <group position={[1, 0, 1]}>
          <mesh ref={register("two", "bar")}>
            <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
            <meshStandardMaterial color={"blue"} />
          </mesh>
        </group>
        <pointLight ref={register("three")} />
      </Canvas>
  );
};


```

</Collapsible>


## Time progress

Perhaps the simplest form of progress is time progress. This progress just continuously updates the scene using the internal `three.js` Clock. It can either loop through the scene, or just run once.

Using the time progress can be applied on any canvas, even with `frameloop="demand"` enabled. *Jongleur* will handle calling `invalidate` on the scene. If you want to learn more about r3f's performance optimizations, checkout their page [here](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/advanced/scaling-performance#on-demand-rendering).


```tsx twoslash {1, 4-6, 16} 
// @include: main

// ---cut---
import { useTimeProgress } from "jongleur";

const TimeProgress = () => {
  // Second parameter (5) is the length of playback in seconds
  // Third parameter (true) controls scrolling behavior
  useTimeProgress(clips, 5, true);
  
  return null;
}

const App: FC = () => {
  const register = useRegister(clips);
  
  return (
      <Canvas>
        <TimeProgress />
        {/* ... */}
      </Canvas>
  );
};
```

<Alert type="important">
The component that calls the `useTimeProgress` hook **must** be used inside of a `Canvas` Component since it uses the [useFrame](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/api/hooks#useframe) hook from r3f.
</Alert>

## Scroll Progress

The most prominent use case of *jongleur* is to connect the keyframe definitions to a scroll pane. This is similar to [`ScrollControls`](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei#scrollcontrols) of `@react-three/drei`. Additionally, a range of useful utility components is also exposed, to make building these scenes even more enjoyable. All scroll-related components are imported via a single object `Scroll`:

```twoslash include scroll
import { Scroll } from "jongleur";
// - 1
```

```ts twoslash
// HINT: hover `Scroll` to see the objects
// @include: scroll-1
```

### `Scroll.Controls`

The most important scroll component is `Scroll.Controls`. Similar to drei's ScrollControls these should ideally (although not completely necessary) wrap your whole scene. This will create scrollable divs in the DOM that overlay your canvas component. Additionally, it also setups the event listeners necessary to feedback the progress to *Jongleur*. 

```tsx twoslash {1, 8, 10} 
// @include: main

// ---cut---
import { Scroll } from "jongleur";

const App: FC = () => {
  const register = useRegister(clips);
  
  return (
      <Canvas>
        <Scroll.Controls clips={clips}>
          {/* ... */}
        </Scroll.Controls>
      </Canvas>
  );
};
```


The length of the scene (eg. the highest numbered keyframe in its definition) will control the length of the created scroll pane. For every whole number of progress in the keyframe, a new page will be added. This is chosen such that scrolling one times the height of the canvas the keyframes between 0 and 1 will be executed.
<Alert type="tip">
In the example above, the last keyframe is at *progress* "one". When using the `Scroll.Controls` a scrollable area of (1+1) = 2 times the height of the canvas is created. Therefore the whole animation will be completed after the user scrolls once the size of the container.
</Alert>

<Alert type="info">
At the current moment, this behavior is fixed. I have planned to include a `scale` parameter, however, it is not trivial to decide how that should interact with the positioning utility `Scroll.At`. If you have an idea on how that should behave or just want to push the progress on that, check out the GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/lucafanselau/jongleur/issues/2).
</Alert>

### Positioning

When working with the `Scroll.Controls` you will probably want to position some HTML content in front of the canvas. Similar to the cards on the landing page of this website. There are mainly two ways of positioning content: Fixed and scrollable.

#### Scroll.At Utility

The most important component for positioning elements on screen is the Scroll.At Utility. Using the  

#### Fixed Contents

import scrollable from "./scrollable.png";

<img src={scrollable} />

Fixed contents are those that remain at the same place above the canvas during the scrolling. This is useful if you have something like an "action" button, that you always want to remain clickable. To have something like that start by defining 


## Custom progress

*Jongleur* also exposes an API that can be fed arbitrary progress information. If you want to, for example, build a stepper component or a controlled timeline. This is more of an advanced feature and will therefore get an extra guide under the advanced section later. If there is a tinkerer out there, who wants to build something using this API have a look at the [useProgress](/api/progress#useprogress) hook. Also, make sure to reach out via GitHub to share your use case üëç.
