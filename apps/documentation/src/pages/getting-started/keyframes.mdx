*Jongleur* tries to simplify the process of orchestrating animations of multiple objects in a scene, by having a single source of truth for the keyframes of the whole scene. This approach has multiple benefits in contrast to defining the behavior on a per-component or file basis. The main ones are:

- **Simplicity**: Easier maintenance of complex scenes
- **Independence** from the progress source: time-based animations follow the same structure as scroll-based scenes
- **Safety**: Catch bugs more easily and use typescript to enforce correct keyframes
- **Performance**: Only rerender the screen if something changed (using a [demand frameloop](./progress)) and pre-process as much as possible to increase runtime performance

## The `orchestrate` function

The key part of the API that is concerned with processing a scene and the keyframes for that scene to the data struct that is used during runtime.

<Alert type="tip">
On the terminology of the orchestrate function: The inputs to the orchestration function are the `Base` definition of the scene, the `Keyframes` for the scene and a `Config`. The **result** is a store that contains the processed `Clips`. For the sake of this tutorial **clips** will always refer to the output of the orchestration function.
</Alert>

Let's first look at a complete example and then go over the three inputs to the function and their possible values. During the discussion, we will also discover which errors the library catches and how those should be handled.

<Alert type="info">
All of the code examples here are powered by [shiki-twoslash](https://github.com/shikijs/twoslash). You can hover the *identifiers* and get a type description, similar to the tooltips you get in your IDE.
</Alert>

<Code code={test} theme={"nord"} />

Overall, this example animation sequence has two objects `one` and `two`. The object `one` starts being invisible (`opacity: 0`) and is transitioned to being fully visible at *progress* `1`. The object `two` is moved around during the animation. Starting at position `[0, 0, 0]`, at which the object remains until *progress* `0.5`. After that it is moved to `[1, 1, 1]`, finishing its transition at the same time the first object is fully visible.

<Alert type="info">
The term *progress* is used since progress can represent various sources of progress. During the keyframe definition, it is sufficient to think of the progress as a time stamp. For more information, you can advance to the dedicated documentation page [here](./progress)
</Alert>

## The `Base` & scene definition

The first parameter to the `orchestrate` function. The `Base` defines what objects are animated in your scene and what fields these objects use. In the example from above, we define two objects, animating the `opacity` and the `position` fields respectively. The property `config` is a special case, that will be covered in greater detail [below](#config).

<Code code={test} theme={"nord"} range={[5, 12]} />

Objects can be identified by any valid property key. Such as `one` and `two` as in the example, but even arbitrary strings like `"Scene Object 123"`. It is however advised to use concise identifiers.

The fields that are used in each object come from a common set of fields that should cover most of the use cases for 3D & DOM animations. A list can be found [here](./fields). For more advanced use cases you can also extend the list of fields as outlined in [Custom Fields](../advanced/fields). Any modern IDE should also provide autocompletion for the available fields. 

Every field also specifies which type is expected for that field. The `opacity` field requires a `number` value. Passing another type leads to a typescript error:

```ts twoslash
import { orchestrate } from "jongleur";

// @errors: 2322
orchestrate({
// ---cut---
  one: {
    opacity: "definitely not an opacity"
  }
// ---cut-after---
}, {}, {})
```

Type typing of the functions also enforces that the base state does not use any unknown fields:

```ts twoslash
import { orchestrate } from "jongleur";
import { Vector3 } from "three";

// @errors: 2345
// ---cut---
orchestrate(
  {
    one: {
      position: new Vector3(0, 0, 0),
      ooooopacity: 0,
    },
  },
  // ---cut-after---
  {},
  {}
);
```

<Alert type="warn">
Since the `orchestrate` function is generic over the `Base` such that the keyframe definition can enforce the concrete structure of the scene, the error message is a bit *ugly*. Always look for the `[unknown-fields]` template string in the error message. It will tell you which field exactly is mispelled.
</Alert>

## Keyframe definition

After defining the base, the next step is to define the keyframes. Keyframes define certain points in the "progress" where you want to scene and its objects to be in a specific state. *Jongleur* uses this information and transitions automatically between states. 

<Alert type="info">
You can freely decide in which domains the keyframes are. You can have every keyframe between `0` and `1`, or have every important state of the scene at an absolute number `0, 1, 2, ...`. If you plan to work with [scroll utilities](./progress#scroll), it is beneficial to have important scene states at absolute numbers.
</Alert>

Let's look at the definition of the keyframes in the example again:

<Code code={test} theme={"nord"} range={[13, 24]} />

<Alert type="important">
**Every** object has an *implicit* keyframe at progress `0` with the state defined in the `Base`!
</Alert>

The keyframe definition expects one property for every object that was defined in the scene so in our case `one` and `two`. Every object can contain an arbitrary amount of keyframes. The key indicates the **progress** and the value is an object that can, but does not have to, contain any of the fields that were registered in the `Base` object. 

Per default, every object is transitioned from the last keyframe to the current one. This behavior can be overridden using the `inherit` helper. The default behavior for the `second` object with the keyframe at `1` would lead to an interpolation from **progress** `0` to `1`. This might be undesirable. Technically the `inherit` flag copies the last state of the field into the current keyframe. In the library we use the term "clip" for a complete transition between states.

Every state can optionally be annotated with a config. The configuration system is explained in greater detail [below](#config).

The keyframe definition is also strictly typed to ensure correct usage of the `orchestrate` function. Let's look at some common errors...

Starting with misspelled fields or using fields that are not registered in the `Base`:

```ts twoslash
import { orchestrate, helpers } from "jongleur";
import { Vector3 } from "three";

// @errors: 2322
orchestrate(
  {
    one: {
      opacity: 0,
    },
  },
// ---cut---
  {
    one: {
      1: { 
        oooopacity: helpers.state(1),
      }
    }
  },
  // ---cut-after---
  {}
);

```

And also mismatching types for the fields:

```ts twoslash
import { orchestrate, helpers } from "jongleur";
import { Vector3 } from "three";

// @errors: 2322
orchestrate(
  {
    one: {
      opacity: 0,
    },
  },
// ---cut---
  {
    one: {
      1: { 
        opacity: helpers.state("also not an opacity"),
      }
    }
  },
  // ---cut-after---
  {}
);

```

<Alert type="info">
The `helpers.state` function is not needed here, it just makes the tree structure a bit less verbose. You can also provide an object with keys `value` and `config`.
</Alert>

## Config

As already described above a transition between keyframes is called a `Clip`. Every clip has a config attached to it. This config can be overridden at any level. As a fallback, every clip has the global config applied (eg. the third argument to the `orchestrate` function). Single fields of this config can be overridden at the *object* level (in the `Base`) or at the clip level (in the `Keyframes`)


```ts twoslash 
import { orchestrate, helpers, useRegister } from "jongleur";
console.log("error")
console.log("error")

// @errors: 2322
const clips = orchestrate(
    {
        first: { opacity: 0 },
        second: { opacity: 1 }
    }, 
    {
       first: { 1: { opacity: helpers.state(1) } },
       second: { 1: 
       { ooopacity: helpers.state(0) }}
    },
    {}
)

const register = useRegister(clips); // highlighted
//    ^?
```
