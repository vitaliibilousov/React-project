This page is a WIP, for now, check out the following projects:

- [Next.js starter project](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-next)
- [spline.design](https://spline.design/) and their [export](https://docs.spline.design/77c32288501a479fa8bc5e787f1e0878) as an react-three fiber scene
- And the example in the jongleur GitHub

You can also check out the starter on stackblitz if you just want to toy around or test out the features while reading the documentation:

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/edit/jongleur-starter?file=src/App.css)

And continue with the documentation, as that covers most of the aspects of the library!
