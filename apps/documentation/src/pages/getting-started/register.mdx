import Alert from "@components/alerts.astro";

```twoslash include main
import { helpers, orchestrate } from "jongleur";
import { Vector3 } from "three";

const clips = orchestrate(
  // The `Base`
  {
    one: {
      opacity: 0,
      config: { damping: false },
    },
    two: { position: new Vector3(0, 0, 0) },
    // NOTE: New object for the showcase
    three: {
      intensity: 0, 
      position: new Vector3(0, 0, 0)
    }
  },
  // The `Keyframes`
  {
    one: {
      1: { opacity: helpers.state(1) },
    },
    two: {
      0.5: { position: helpers.inherit },
      1: {
        position: helpers.state(new Vector3(1, 1, 1), "ease-in-out"),
      },
    },
    three: {}
  },
  // The `Config`
  {
    damping: true,
    interpolation: "linear",
  }
);
```

Registering objects is done through a mechanism inspired by `React.RefCallback`. It is therefore compatible with the `ref` field of DOM Elements as well as r3f objects. On this page we will work with the same example as in the [keyframes explanation](./keyframes), for the sake of demonstrating the `useRegister` hook we added a third element that uses multiple fields:

```tsx twoslash {12-16}
// @include: main
```

<Alert type="info">
`opacity` is a field for DOM Elements and `position` is used in a r3f context. Both \"worlds\" can be mixed when working with *jongleur*.
</Alert>

## Register hook 

The most important hook for registering objects is the `useRegister` hook. As an input, it just requires our clips store that we received from the `orchestrate` function. So lets create an App Component that will contain our whole scene:

```tsx twoslash {5}
// @include: main

// ---cut---
import { FC } from "react";
import { useRegister } from "jongleur";

const App: FC = () => {
    const register = useRegister(clips);
    return null;
}
```

As you can see when hovering `register`, the register hook reuses the types from the clip store. The types may be omitted because of the length, but they are there ðŸ˜‰. 

The function returned by the register hook follows the type `(obj: keyof Base, id?: string) => React.RefCallback<...>`. In the example `keyof Base = "one" | "two" | "three"` as that are the objects that we added to our scene. The second parameter allows multiple scene objects to be registered for the same `keyof Base`.

<Alert type="important">
When registering something with *jongleur* the last recorded progress is always applied to the objects. If you are registering the objects directly, the `Base` state will be applied. This ensures that objects are always in sync with the progress.
</Alert>

## Type of RefCallback

In the previous section, the type of the RefCallback was omitted. This is because it is actually a more complex type dependent on the fields that this specific `obj` is using:

```tsx twoslash {6-8}
// @include: main

// ---cut---
import { FC } from "react";
import { useRegister } from "jongleur";

const App: FC = () => {
    const register = useRegister(clips);
    const refOne = register("one");
    const refTwo = register("two");
    const refThree = register("three");
    return null;
}
```

Normally you would use the register function in the ref attribute directly. But here you can hover over and see the inferred type for the seperate scene objects. Every field requires a specific object to which the field can be applied too. `opacity` requires an `HTMLElement`, `position` a `three.Object3D` and `intensity` a `three.Light`. The corresponding types are called `Target` in the library. These are also documented for each field [here](./fields). When [adding your own fields](../advanced/fields) you can also specify target types.

If an object has multiple fields specified, like object `three`, the `RefCallback` requires an intersection type (`&`) of all fields. So for `three` this requires `three.Object3D & three.Light`. This ensures that the attached objects actually support the fields.

## Usage with JSX

So let's create a simple scene and add the references.

```tsx twoslash {8-17}
// @include: main

// ---cut---
import { FC } from "react";
import { Canvas } from "@react-three/fiber";
import { useRegister } from "jongleur";

const App: FC = () => {
  const register = useRegister(clips);
  return (
    <div>
      <h1 ref={register("one")}>Bad example text</h1>
      <Canvas>
        <mesh ref={register("two")}>
          <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
          <meshStandardMaterial color={"orange"} />
        </mesh>
        <pointLight ref={register("three")} />
      </Canvas>
    </div>
  );
};
```

And that's basically it when using the `useRegister` hook. It is designed to be as intuitive as possible while also enforcing correct usage.

## Errors during register

*Jongleur* notifies you during development if you are misusing the hook. The error message will tell you which type is expected and which one you provided:

```tsx twoslash {2}
// @include: main

// @errors: 2322
import { FC } from "react";
import { Canvas } from "@react-three/fiber";
import { useRegister } from "jongleur";

const App: FC = () => {
  const register = useRegister(clips);
  return (
// ---cut---
      <Canvas>
        <mesh ref={register("one")}>
          <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
          <meshStandardMaterial color={"orange"} />
        </mesh>
        <pointLight ref={register("three")} />
      </Canvas>
// ---cut-after---
  );
};
```

## Register multiple targets for one object

Sometimes you want multiple objects in the scene to be controlled by the definition in you keyframes. To do this you can use the second parameter during register:

```tsx twoslash {2,7}
// @include: main

import { FC } from "react";
import { Canvas } from "@react-three/fiber";
import { useRegister } from "jongleur";

const App: FC = () => {
  const register = useRegister(clips);
  return (
// ---cut---
      <Canvas>
        <mesh ref={register("two", "foo")}>
          <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
          <meshStandardMaterial color={"orange"} />
        </mesh>
        <group position={[1, 0, 1]}>
          <mesh ref={register("two", "bar")}>
            <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
            <meshStandardMaterial color={"blue"} />
          </mesh>
        </group>
        <pointLight ref={register("three")} />
      </Canvas>
// ---cut-after---
  );
};
```

Reusing keyframe definitions can help to shorten the numbers of clips you have to write.

## Usage with external objects

You can also register objects directly, without the `ref` attribute. Doing this might be required for objects like the main camera, which you don't mount yourself. Just remember to unregister the object as well. A `useEffect` can be used to replicate this behavior:

```tsx twoslash {3-10}
// @include: main

import { FC, useEffect } from "react";
import { Canvas, useThree } from "@react-three/fiber";
import { useRegister } from "jongleur";

const App: FC = () => {
// ---cut---
  const register = useRegister(clips);
  
  const camera = useThree(s => s.camera);
  useEffect(() => {
    // register the camera as the object
    register("two", "camera")(camera);
    // Also unregister on "unmount" to replicate 
    // the ref callback behavior of react
    return () => register("two", "camera")(null);
  }, [camera, register]);
  
// ---cut-after---
  return (
      <Canvas>
        <mesh ref={register("two", "foo")}>
          <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
          <meshStandardMaterial color={"orange"} />
        </mesh>
        <group position={[1, 0, 1]}>
          <mesh ref={register("two", "bar")}>
            <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
            <meshStandardMaterial color={"blue"} />
          </mesh>
        </group>
        <pointLight ref={register("three")} />
      </Canvas>
  );
};
```

But unfortunately, the scene won't be doing anything right now. We still need a way to provide progress to the clips. This will be tackled on the next page, hang on we are nearly finished...
