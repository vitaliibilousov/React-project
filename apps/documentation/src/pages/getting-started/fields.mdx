import Alert from "@components/alerts.astro"

<Alert type="warn">
The documentation of fields is incomplete, as I hope that the list is extended greatly up until v1.0. If you have fields, that you feel are useful to include in the *standard library* feel free to open a pr on github. Consult the [Custom Field Tutorial](/advanced/fields) to get started.
</Alert>

For now the most current list of fields, seperated into DOM Fields (for "normal" html elements) and three.js fields can be found here:
- [DOM Fields](/api/orchestrate#defaultdomfields)
- [three.js Fields](/api/orchestrate#defaultthreefields)
