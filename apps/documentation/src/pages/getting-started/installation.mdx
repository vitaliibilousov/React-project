import PackageManagerTabs from "@components/utils/pkg-tabs.astro"

Jongleur is published as an npm package and can therefore be installed using your favorite package manager:

<PackageManagerTabs cmd="jongleur"/>

The library has peer dependencies on `react`, `react-dom`, `three.js` and `@react-three/fiber`, so make sure those are installed as well. If you are using r3f these should be installed already.

<PackageManagerTabs cmd="react react-dom @react-three/fiber three"/>

Now that everything is installed, you can get started with defining your scene in keyframes.
