description: Adding custom fields is easy with jongleur. Let's go through a simple usage example
---
import Alert from "@components/alerts.astro"

Together with the `orchestrate`, that was introduced [here](/getting-started/keyframes), there is also a "higher-order" function called `createOrchestrate`.
Internally this is also used to *create* the orchestrate function with the set of [default fields](/getting-started/fields).

The process of adding custom fields is therefore as easy as creating your own orchestrate function:

```ts twoslash
import { createOrchestrate, defaultFields } from "jongleur";

const myOrchestrate = createOrchestrate({
    // NOTE: it is always a good idea to include 
    // the standard set of field
    ...defaultFields
});
```

For this example, lets add the "visibility" field to our custom orchestrate function:

```ts twoslash
import { createOrchestrate, defaultFields, createField } from "jongleur";

const myOrchestrate = createOrchestrate({
    // NOTE: it is always a good idea to include 
    // the standard set of field
    ...defaultFields,
    // this is the custom field
    visibility: createField<HTMLElement, boolean>((target, a, b, alpha) => {
        const interpolated = alpha > 0.5 ? b : a;
        target.style.visibility = interpolated ? "visible" : "hidden";
    })
});
```

Let's go through the creation of the new field:
- First of we have to give the field a name, we have choosen to name it "visibilty" for obvious reasons. Any valid object key is fine though. This will be the name that you will have to use to reference this field when using `myOrchestrate`.
- Next up we use the utility function `createField`. This field is generic over two types: The `Target` and the `Store`. The `Target` is the type that will be expected by the register hook for objects that are using that field. It generally is advised to use the highest possible abstraction available. For DOM Elements this mostly is `HTMLElement` and for three.js objects mostly `Object3D`. The `Store` type is the expected type that has to be supplied in the keyframe definitions for this field. So in this case during the `Base` definition (as discussed [here](/getting-started/keyframes)) the user can just write something like `{ myObject: { visibility: false } }`
- The last step is to associate an apply function for this field. The job of this callback is to take an object of type `Target` and apply a value to it. Since the object might be in transition between two stores this function also has the task of interpolating between `a` and `b`, by `alpha`. 


<Alert type="info">
If you want to interpolate a single number, you can use the provided utility from jongleur `import { lerp } from "jongleur";`. For interpolating three.js vectors, you can create a temporary Vector `const vec = new Vector3()` and use the integrated lerpVectors function like this: `target["THE_FIELD"].setFromVector3(vec.lerpVectors(a, b, alpha))`

And thats more or less it. All other parts of the library are generic over the set of fields, so everything should continue, like they were added in the library itself. If you feel like the field your added is helpful to others, consider adding a pull request for it^^.
