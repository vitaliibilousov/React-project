Welcome to the API Documentation of *jongleur*. This documentation is auto-generated using [typedoc](https://typedoc.org/), [typedoc-plugin-markdown](https://github.com/tgreyuk/typedoc-plugin-markdown) and a custom-derived theme packaged in an astro integration. You can check out github if you are interested in the source and if there is demand that could be published as an external astro integration.

The documentation is structured the same way as the source code. *Jongleur* consists of the following modules:

# Modules

- [orchestrate](orchestrate)
- [progress](progress)
- [scroll](scroll)
- [store](store)
- [utils](utils)
