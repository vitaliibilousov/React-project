          This demo shows off some of the features from the library! Check out
          the documentation for usage examples and in depth explanations of the
          api. You can also check out the github to see the full source-code of
          the library and this website:

        <p>
          Using a keyframe inspired notation, you can orchestrate complex scene
          animations that work with <Code>three.js</Code> objects and DOM
          Elements. The resulting clips can be applied and advanced by any form
          of progress, such as scroll or time.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, you already saw these effects applied to this card and the
          "Start by scrolling" label on the first page.
        </p>
        <p>
          The real power of the library is combining this with animations in a
          3d scene. You probably already noticed the empty room, hopefully it
          wont be this empty on the next page...

          Per default, a damping effect is applied to the scroll progress, which
          ensures that the animation remains smooth even when the scroll jumps
          around. As this is just a prop to the <Code>Scroll.Controls</Code>{" "}
          Component, we can even change that based on user input. Here try for
          yourself:

        <div>
          <ReactSlider
            min={0.1}
            max={10}
            step={0.1}
            value={damping}
            className={"h-4 mt-2 w-full cursor-grab"}
            trackClassName={"h-2 bg-slate-200 dark:bg-slate-700 rounded-md"}
            thumbClassName={
              "rounded-full h-4 w-4 bg-slate-700 dark:bg-slate-200 -translate-x-1/2 -top-1 focus:outline-none"
            }
            onChange={(value) => setDamping(value)}
          />

        <p className={"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 text-sm"}>
          Note: 0.1 is extremely slow üêå and 10 is snappy üöÄ
        </p>
        <p>
          You can even disable damping for any object or even any single
          animation in the scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          At least now the room is not that empty anymore, but{" "}
          <span className={"contents italic"}>wait</span> there is more that we

        <p>
          Animations can also modify multiple fields simultaneously and
          interleaved, such as the position, rotation and scale of a{" "}
          <Code>three.js</Code> object.

          Hint: If that happened a bit to fast, try to go back and adjust the
          `damping` to a smaller value.

          The library provides a set of default fields to be animated. These
          include common fields for DOM Elements and three.js elements like{" "}
          <Code>Object3D</Code>, <Code>Camera</Code>, <Code>Light</Code> and
          their descendants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, its extremely easy to add your own fields to work with
          your custom classes and objects. The possibilities are endless...
