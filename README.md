## Description

Jongleur is a library that aims to make orchestrating complex 3d animations on websites easier to maintain and scale. Animations of different objects are expressed in an object notation, that is inspired by keyframes, such as commonly found in many animation softwares. This allows having a single source of truth for the movement of objects in the scene.

If you are interested, let's get started with the [documentation](https://jongleur-docs.vercel.app)


## TODO:
- [ ] Margin around keyframes
- [ ] 'eps' issue
- [ ] horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Spring movement
- [ ] Sticky Scroll Controls (like stripe or owna.world)
- [ ] Better in code documentation
