## Description

Jongleur is a library that aims to make orchestrating complex 3d animations on websites easier to maintain and scale. Animations of different objects are expressed in an object notation, that is insprired by keyframes, such as commonly found in many animation softwares. This allows to have a single source of truth for the movement of objects in the scene.
