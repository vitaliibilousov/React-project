## Description

Jongleur is a library that aims to make orchestrating complex 3d animations on websites easier to maintain and scale. Animations of different objects are expressed in an object notation, that is inspired by keyframes, such as commonly found in many animation softwares. This allows having a single source of truth for the movement of objects in the scene.

Here are some of the main benefits of using _jongleur_:

- 🔒 **Fully type safe**: Advanced typescript features ensure that animations are valid
- 🏎 **Performance optimized**: Demand-based frameloop is fully supported
- 📒 **Single source of truth**: Simple maintenance of large scenes
- ➡️ **Progress abstraction**: Animations can be driven by scroll, time or other forms of input
- 🖱 **Scroll Utilities**: Create stunning scroll based interactive sites with a toolbox of React components
